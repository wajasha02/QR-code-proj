## My process

### Built with

I built this project using:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
  For styles

### What I learned

In this project, I reinforced my understanding of HTML and CSS for creating responsive layouts. I also learned about using Flexbox for alignment and positioning of elements within containers.

### Continued development

I aim to continue improving my skills in responsive design and CSS techniques, particularly exploring CSS Grid further for more complex layouts. Additionally, I plan to delve into JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to my projects.

### Useful resources

- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) - this helped me grasp Flexbox concepts and apply them effectively in my project. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.
